# Stock Analyzer Verion 1.0

### Introduction

This is a python program designed to help screen stocks and perform basic technical analysis. All stock data is acquired from free sources (Yahoo and Google). Changing URLs for these services is likely to make the program crash periodically. It should also be noted that this program does not provide any capabilities over and above other software out there, it was just written to get a better understanding of stock prices, analysis, etc.
